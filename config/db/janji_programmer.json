I will not knowingly allow code that is defective either in behavior or structure to accumulate.</li>\r\n    <li>I will produce, with each release, a quick, sure, and repeatable proof that every element of the code works as it should.</li>\r\n    <li>I will make frequent, small, releases so that I do not impede the progress of others.</li>\r\n    <li>I will fearlessly and relentlessly improve my creations at every opportunity. I will never degrade them.</li>\r\n    <li>I will do all that I can to keep the productivity of myself, and others, as high as possible. I will do nothing that decreases that productivity.</li>\r\n    <li>I will continuously ensure that others can cover for me, and that I can cover for them.</li>\r\n    <li>I will produce estimates that are honest both in magnitude and precision. I will not make promises without certainty.</li>\r\n    <li>I will never stop learning and improving my craft.</li>\r\n",
